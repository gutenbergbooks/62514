<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>Long ago I was captivated by the charm of the
Jataka Tales and realized the excellent use that might
be made of them in the teaching of children. The
obvious lessons are many of them suitable for little
people, and beneath the obvious there are depths and
depths of meaning which they may learn to fathom
later on. The Oriental setting lends an additional
fascination. I am glad that Miss Babbitt has undertaken
to put together this collection, and commend it
freely to teachers and parents.</p>

<h2>PUBLISHER'S NOTE</h2></div>


<p>The Jatakas, or Birth-stories, form one of the sacred
books of the Buddhists and relate to the adventures
of the Buddha in his former existences, the best character
in any story being identified with the Master.</p>

<p>These legends were continually introduced into the
religious discourses of the Buddhist teachers to illustrate
the doctrines of their faith or to magnify the
glory and sanctity of the Buddha, somewhat as medieval
preachers in Europe used to enliven their sermons
by introducing fables and popular tales to rouse the
flagging interest of their hearers.</p>

<p>Sculptured scenes from the Jatakas, found upon the
carved railings around the relic shrines of Sanchi and
Amaravati and of Bharhut, indicate that the "Birth-stories"
were widely known in the third century
B.C., and were then considered as part of the sacred
history of the religion. At first the tales were probably
handed down orally, and it is uncertain when
they were put together in systematic form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
While some of the stories are Buddhistic and depend
for their point on some custom or idea peculiar to
Buddhism, many are age-old fables, the flotsam and
jetsam of folk-lore, which have appeared under various
guises throughout the centuries, as when they were
used by Boccaccio or Poggio, merely as merry tales, or
by Chaucer, who unwittingly puts a Jataka story into
the mouth of his pardoners when he tells the tale of
"the Ryotoures three."</p>

<p>Quaint humor and gentle earnestness distinguish
these legends and they teach many wholesome lessons,
among them the duty of kindness to animals.</p>

<p>Dr. Felix Adler in his "Moral Instruction of Children,"
says:</p>

<p class="i2 p2">The Jataka Tales contain deep truths, and are calculated
to impress lessons of great moral beauty. The tale
of the Merchant of Seri, who gave up all that he had in
exchange for a golden dish, embodies much the same idea
as the parable of the priceless Pearl, in the New Testament.
The tale of the Measure of Rice illustrates the importance
of a true estimate of values. The tale of the Banyan Deer,
which offered its life to save a doe and her young, illustrates
self-sacrifice of the noblest sort. The tale of the
Sandy Road is one of the finest in the collection.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
And he adds that these tales "are, as everyone must
admit, nobly conceived, lofty in meaning, and many a
helpful sermon might be preached from them as texts."</p>

THE MONKEY AND THE CROCODILE</h2></div>


<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>A monkey lived in a great tree on a river
bank.</p>

<p>In the river there were many Crocodiles.</p>

<p>A Crocodile watched the Monkeys for a long time,
and one day she said to her son: "My son, get one of
those Monkeys for me. I want the heart of a Monkey
to eat."</p>

<p>"How am I to catch a Monkey?" asked the little
Crocodile. "I do not travel on land, and the Monkey
does not go into the water."</p>

<p>"Put your wits to work, and you'll find a way,"
said the mother.</p>

<p>And the little Crocodile thought and thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
At last he said to himself: "I know what I'll do.
I'll get that Monkey that lives in a big tree on the
river bank. He wishes to go across the river to the
island where the fruit is so ripe."</p>

<p>So the Crocodile swam to the tree where the
Monkey lived. But he was a stupid Crocodile.</p>

<p>"Oh, Monkey," he called, "come with me over to
the island where the fruit is so ripe."</p>

<p>"How can I go with you?" asked the Monkey. "I
do not swim."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but I do. I will take you over on my back,"
said the Crocodile.</p>

<p>The Monkey was greedy, and wanted the ripe fruit,
so he jumped down on the Crocodile's back.</p>

<p>"Off we go!" said the Crocodile.</p>

<p>"This is a fine ride you are giving me!" said the
Monkey.</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Well, how do you like this?"
asked the Crocodile, diving.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" cried the Monkey, as he went under
the water. He was afraid to let go, and he did not
know what to do under the water.</p>

<p>When the Crocodile came up, the Monkey sputtered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and choked. "Why did you take me under water,
Crocodile?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am going to kill you by keeping you under
water," answered the Crocodile. "My mother wants
Monkey-heart to eat, and I'm going to take yours to
her."</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p005.jpg" width="500"
height="195" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
"Why did you take me under water, Crocodile?" he asked.
</div></div>

<p>"I wish you had told me you wanted my heart,"
said the Monkey, "then I might have brought it with
me."</p>

<p>"How queer!" said the stupid Crocodile. "Do you
mean to say that you left your heart back there in
the tree?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean," said the Monkey. "If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
want my heart, we must go back to the tree and get it.
But we are so near the island where the ripe fruit is,
please take me there first."</p>

<p>"No, Monkey," said the Crocodile, "I'll take you
straight back to your tree. Never mind the ripe fruit.
Get your heart and bring it to me at once. Then
we'll see about going to the island."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Monkey.</p>

<p>But no sooner had he jumped onto the bank of the
river than&mdash;whisk! up he ran into the tree.</p>

<p>From the topmost branches he called down to the
Crocodile in the water below:</p>

<p>"My heart is way up here! If you want it, come
for it, come for it!"</p>


<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>The monkey soon moved away from that tree.</p>

<p>He wanted to get away from the Crocodile,
so that he might live in peace.</p>

<p>But the Crocodile found him, far down the river,
living in another tree.</p>

<p>In the middle of the river was an island covered
with fruit-trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Half-way between the bank of the river and the
island, a large rock rose out of the water. The Monkey
could jump to the rock, and then to the island.
The Crocodile watched the Monkey crossing from
the bank of the river to the rock, and then to the
island.</p>

<p>He thought to himself, "The Monkey will stay on
the island all day, and I'll catch him on his way home
at night."</p>

<p>The Monkey had a fine feast, while the Crocodile
swam about, watching him all day.</p>

<p>Toward night the Crocodile crawled out of the
water and lay on the rock, perfectly still.</p>

<p>When it grew dark among the trees, the Monkey
started for home. He ran down to the river bank,
and there he stopped.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with the rock?" the Monkey
thought to himself. "I never saw it so high before.
The Crocodile is lying on it!"</p>

<p>But he went to the edge of the water and called:
"Hello, Rock!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Then he called again: "Hello, Rock!"</p>

<p>Three times the Monkey called, and then he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
"Why is it, Friend Rock, that you do not answer me
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the stupid Crocodile to himself, "the
rock answers the Monkey at night. I'll have to answer
for the rock this time."</p>

<p>So he answered: "Yes, Monkey! What is it?"</p>

<p>The Monkey laughed, and said: "Oh, it's you,
Crocodile, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Crocodile. "I am waiting here for
you. I am going to eat you."</p>

<p>"You have caught me in a trap this time," said the
Monkey. "There is no other way for me to go home.
Open your mouth wide so I can jump right into it."</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p008.jpg" width="500"
height="223" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
The Monkey jumped.
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Now the Monkey well knew that when Crocodiles
open their mouths wide, they shut their eyes.</p>

<p>While the Crocodile lay on the rock with his mouth
wide open and his eyes shut, the Monkey jumped.</p>

<p>But not into his mouth! Oh, no! He landed on
the top of the Crocodile's head, and then sprang
quickly to the bank. Up he whisked into his tree.</p>

<p>When the Crocodile saw the trick the Monkey had
played on him, he said: "Monkey, you have great
cunning. You know no fear. I'll let you alone after
this."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Crocodile, but I shall be on the watch
for you just the same," said the Monkey.</p>

<h2 id="II">II.<br />
HOW THE TURTLE SAVED HIS OWN LIFE</h2></div>


<p>A king once had a lake made in the courtyard
for the young princes to play in. They swam
about in it, and sailed their boats and rafts
on it. One day the king told them he had asked the
men to put some fishes into the lake.</p>

<p>Off the boys ran to see the fishes. Now, along with
the fishes, there was a Turtle. The boys were delighted
with the fishes, but they had never seen a Turtle,
and they were afraid of it, thinking it was a
demon. They ran back to their father, crying,
"There is a demon on the bank of the lake."</p>

<p>The king ordered his men to catch the demon, and
to bring it to the palace. When the Turtle was
brought in, the boys cried and ran away.</p>

<p>The king was very fond of his sons, so he ordered
the men who had brought the Turtle to kill it.</p>

<p>"How shall we kill it?" they asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
"Pound it to powder," said some one. "Bake it in
hot coals," said another.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p011.jpg" width="500"
height="303" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
"Throw the thing into the lake."
</div></div>

<p>So one plan after another was spoken of. Then an
old man who had always been afraid of the water
said: "Throw the thing into the lake where it flows
out over the rocks into the river. Then it will surely
be killed."</p>

<p>When the Turtle heard what the old man said, he
thrust out his head and asked: "Friend, what have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I done that you should do such a dreadful thing as
that to me? The other plans were bad enough, but
to throw me into the lake! Don't speak of such a
cruel thing!"</p>

<p>When the king heard what the Turtle said, he told
his men to take the Turtle at once and throw it into
the lake.</p>

<p>The Turtle laughed to himself as he slid away down
the river to his old home. "Good!" he said, "those
people do not know how safe I am in the water!"</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="III">III.<br />
THE MERCHANT OF SERI</h2></div>


<p>There was once a merchant of Seri who sold
brass and tinware. He went from town to
town, in company with another man, who also
sold brass and tinware. This second man was greedy,
getting all he could for nothing, and giving as little
as he could for what he bought.</p>

<p>When they went into a town, they divided the streets
between them. Each man went up and down the
streets he had chosen, calling, "Tinware for sale.
Brass for sale." People came out to their door-steps,
and bought, or traded, with them.</p>

<p>In one house there lived a poor old woman and her
granddaughter. The family had once been rich, but
now the only thing they had left of all their riches was
a golden bowl. The grandmother did not know it
was a golden bowl, but she had kept this because her
husband used to eat out of it in the old days. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
stood on a shelf among the other pots and pans, and
was not often used.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p014.jpg" width="500"
height="291" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
He threw the bowl on the ground.
</div></div>

<p>The greedy merchant passed this house, calling,
"Buy my water-jars! Buy my pans!" The granddaughter
said: "Oh, Grandmother, do buy something
for me!"</p>

<p>"My dear," said the old woman, "we are too poor
to buy anything. I have not anything to trade,
even."</p>

<p>"Grandmother, see what the merchant will give for
the old bowl. We do not use that, and perhaps he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
will take it and give us something we want for it."</p>

<p>The old woman called the merchant and showed
him the bowl, saying, "Will you take this, sir, and
give the little girl here something for it?"</p>

<p>The greedy man took the bowl and scratched its
side with a needle. Thus he found that it was a
golden bowl. He hoped he could get it for nothing, so
he said: "What is this worth? Not even a halfpenny."
He threw the bowl on the ground, and went
away.</p>

<p>By and by the other merchant passed the house.
For it was agreed that either merchant might go
through any street which the other had left. He
called: "Buy my water-jars! Buy my tinware!
Buy my brass!"</p>

<p>The little girl heard him, and begged her grandmother
to see what he would give for the bowl.</p>

<p>"My child," said the grandmother, "the merchant
who was just here threw the bowl on the ground
and went away. I have nothing else to offer in
trade."</p>

<p>"But, Grandmother," said the girl, "that was a
cross man. This one looks pleasant. Ask him.
Perhaps he'll give some little tin dish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"Call him, then, and show it to him," said the old
woman.</p>

<p>As soon as the merchant took the bowl in his hands,
he knew it was of gold. He said: "All that I have
here is not worth so much as this bowl. It is a golden
bowl. I am not rich enough to buy it."</p>

<p>"But, sir, a merchant who passed here a few moments
ago, threw it on the ground, saying it was not
worth a halfpenny, and he went away," said the
grandmother. "It was worth nothing to him. If
you value it, take it, giving the little girl some dish
she likes for it."</p>

<p>But the merchant would not have it so. He gave
the woman all the money he had, and all his wares.
"Give me but eight pennies," he said.</p>

<p>So he took the pennies, and left. Going quickly to
the river, he paid the boatman the eight pennies to
take him across the river.</p>

<p>Soon the greedy merchant went back to the house
where he had seen the golden bowl, and said: "Bring
that bowl to me, and I will give you something for it."</p>

<p>"No," said the grandmother. "You said the bowl
was worthless, but another merchant has paid a great
price for it, and taken it away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p017.jpg" width="500"
height="276" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
"It is a golden bowl."
</div></div>

<p>Then the greedy merchant was angry, crying out,
"Through this other man I have lost a small fortune.
That bowl was of gold."</p>

<p>He ran down to the riverside, and, seeing the other
merchant in the boat out in the river, he called:
"Hallo, Boatman! Stop your boat!"</p>

<p>But the man in the boat said: "Don't stop!" So
he reached the city on the other side of the river, and
lived well for a time on the money the bowl brought
him.</p>

THE TURTLE WHO COULDN'T STOP
TALKING</h2></div>


<p>A turtle lived in a pond at the foot of a hill.
Two young wild Geese, looking for food, saw
the Turtle, and talked with him. The next
day the Geese came again to visit the Turtle and they
became very well acquainted. Soon they were great
friends.</p>

<p>"Friend Turtle," the Geese said one day, "we have
a beautiful home far away. We are going to fly back
to it to-morrow. It will be a long but pleasant journey.
Will you go with us?"</p>

<p>"How could I? I have no wings," said the Turtle.</p>

<p>"Oh, we will take you, if only you can keep your
mouth shut, and say not a word to anybody," they
said.</p>

<p>"I can do that," said the Turtle. "Do take me with
you. I will do exactly as you wish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p019a.jpg" width="500"

<div class="caption">
"How could I go with you?" said the Turtle.
</div></div>

<p>So the next day the Geese brought a stick and they
held the ends of it. "Now take the middle of this in
your mouth, and don't say a word until we reach
home," they said.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p019b.jpg" width="500"

<div class="caption">
The Geese sprang into the air.
</div></div>

<p>The Geese then sprang into the air, with the Turtle
between them, holding fast to the stick.</p>

<p>The village children saw the two Geese flying along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with the Turtle and cried out: "Oh, see the Turtle
up in the air! Look at the Geese carrying a Turtle
by a stick! Did you ever see anything more ridiculous
in your life!"</p>

<p>The Turtle looked down and began to say, "Well,
and if my friends carry me, what business is that of
yours?" when he let go, and fell dead at the feet of
the children.</p>

<p>As the two Geese flew on, they heard the people say,
when they came to see the poor Turtle, "That fellow
could not keep his mouth shut. He had to talk, and
so lost his life."</p>

THE OX WHO WON THE FORFEIT</h2></div>


<p>Long ago a man owned a very strong Ox. The
owner was so proud of his Ox, that he boasted
to every man he met about how strong his Ox
was.</p>

<p>One day the owner went into a village, and said to
the men there: "I will pay a forfeit of a thousand
pieces of silver if my strong Ox cannot draw a line of
one hundred wagons."</p>

<p>The men laughed, and said: "Very well; bring
your Ox, and we will tie a hundred wagons in a line
and see your Ox draw them along."</p>

<p>So the man brought his Ox into the village. A
crowd gathered to see the sight. The hundred carts
were in line, and the strong Ox was yoked to the first
wagon.</p>

<p>Then the owner whipped his Ox, and said: "Get
up, you wretch! Get along, you rascal!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
But the Ox had never been talked to in that way,
and he stood still. Neither the blows nor the hard
names could make him move.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p022.jpg" width="500"
height="331" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
"Get along, you rascal."
</div></div>

<p>At last the poor man paid his forfeit, and went sadly
home. There he threw himself on his bed and cried:
"Why did that strong Ox act so? Many a time he
has moved heavier loads easily. Why did he shame
me before all those people?"</p>

<p>At last he got up and went about his work. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he went to feed the Ox that night, the Ox turned to
him and said: "Why did you whip me to-day? You
never whipped me before. Why did you call me
'wretch' and 'rascal'? You never called me hard
names before."</p>

<p>Then the man said: "I will never treat you badly
again. I am sorry I whipped you and called you
names. I will never do so any more. Forgive me."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Ox. "To-morrow I will go
into the village and draw the one hundred carts for
you. You have always been a kind master until to-day.
To-morrow you shall gain what you lost."</p>

<p>The next morning the owner fed the Ox well, and
hung a garland of flowers about his neck. When
they went into the village the men laughed at the man
again.</p>

<p>They said: "Did you come back to lose more
money?"</p>

<p>"To-day I will pay a forfeit of two thousand pieces
of silver if my Ox is not strong enough to pull the one
hundred carts," said the owner.</p>

<p>So again the carts were placed in a line, and the Ox
was yoked to the first. A crowd came to watch again.
The owner said: "Good Ox, show how strong you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are! You fine, fine creature!" And he patted his
neck and stroked his sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p024.jpg" width="500"
height="279" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
A garland of flowers about his neck.
</div></div>

<p>At once the Ox pulled with all his strength. The
carts moved on until the last cart stood where the first
had been.</p>

<p>Then the crowd shouted, and they paid back the
forfeit the man had lost, saying: "Your Ox is the
strongest Ox we ever saw."</p>

<p>And the Ox and the man went home, happy.</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI.<br />
THE SANDY ROAD</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time a merchant, with his goods
packed in many carts, came to a desert. He
was on his way to the country on the other
side of the desert.</p>

<p>The sun shone on the fine sand, making it as hot as
the top of a stove. No man could walk on it in the
sunlight. But at night, after the sun went down, the
sand cooled, and then men could travel upon it.</p>

<p>So the merchant waited until after dark, and then
set out. Besides the goods that he was going to sell,
he took jars of water and of rice, and firewood, so that
the rice could be cooked.</p>

<p>All night long he and his men rode on and on. One
man was the pilot. He rode first, for he knew the
stars, and by them he guided the drivers.</p>

<p>At daybreak they stopped and camped. They unyoked
the oxen, and fed them. They built fires and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
cooked the rice. Then they spread a great awning
over all the carts and the oxen, and the men lay down
under it to rest until sunset.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p026.jpg" width="500"
height="274" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
They built fires and cooked the rice.
</div></div>


<p>In the early evening, they again built fires and
cooked rice. After supper, they folded the awning
and put it away. They yoked the oxen, and, as soon
as the sand was cool, they started again on their journey
across the desert.</p>

<p>Night after night they traveled in this way, resting
during the heat of the day. At last one morning the
pilot said: "In one more night we shall get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the sand." The men were glad to hear this, for they
were tired.</p>

<p>After supper that night the merchant said: "You
may as well throw away nearly all the water and the
firewood. By to-morrow we shall be in the city.
Yoke the oxen and start on."</p>

<p>Then the pilot took his place at the head of the line.
But, instead of sitting up and guiding the drivers,
he lay down in the wagon on the cushions. Soon he
was fast asleep, because he had not slept for many
nights, and the light had been so strong in the daytime
that he had not slept well then.</p>

<p>All night long the oxen went on. Near daybreak,
the pilot awoke and looked at the last stars fading
in the light. "Halt!" he called to the drivers. "We
are in the same place where we were yesterday. The
oxen must have turned about while I slept."</p>

<p>They unyoked the oxen, but there was no water
for them to drink. They had thrown away the water
that was left the night before. So the men spread
the awning over the carts, and the oxen lay down,
tired and thirsty. The men, too, lay down saying,
"The wood and water are gone&mdash;we are lost."</p>

<p>But the merchant said to himself, "This is no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for me to sleep. I must find water. The oxen cannot
go on if they do not have water to drink. The
men must have water. They cannot cook the rice
unless they have water. If I give up, we shall all be
lost!"</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p028.jpg" width="500"
height="264" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
"There must be water somewhere below."
</div></div>

<p>On and on he walked, keeping close watch of the
ground. At last he saw a tuft of grass. "There
must be water somewhere below, or that grass would
not be there," he said.</p>

<p>He ran back, shouting to the men, "Bring the spade
and the hammer!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
They jumped up, and ran with him to the spot
where the grass grew. They began to dig, and by
and by they struck a rock and could dig no further.
Then the merchant jumped down into the hole they
had dug, and put his ear to the rock. "I hear water
running under this rock," he called to them. "We
must not give up!" Then the merchant came up out
of the hole and said to a serving-lad: "My boy, if
you give up we are lost! You go down and try!"</p>

<p>The boy stood up straight and raised the hammer
high above his head and hit the rock as hard as ever
he could. He would not give in. They must be
saved. Down came the hammer. This time the
rock broke. And the boy had hardly time to get out
of the well before it was full of cool water. The men
drank as if they never could get enough, and then they
watered the oxen, and bathed.</p>

<p>Then they split up their extra yokes and axles, and
built a fire, and cooked their rice. Feeling better,
they rested through the day. They set up a flag on
the well for travelers to see.</p>

<p>At sundown, they started on again, and the next
morning reached the city, where they sold the goods,
and then returned home.</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII.<br />
THE QUARREL OF THE QUAILS</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time many quails lived together
in a forest. The wisest of them all was their
leader.</p>

<p>A man lived near the forest and earned his living
by catching quails and selling them. Day after day
he listened to the note of the leader calling the quails.
By and by this man, the fowler, was able to call the
quails together. Hearing the note the quails thought
it was their leader who called.</p>

<p>When they were crowded together, the fowler
threw his net over them and off he went into the town,
where he soon sold all the quails that he had caught.</p>

<p>The wise leader saw the plan of the fowler for
catching the quails. He called the birds to him and
said, "This fowler is carrying away so many of us,
we must put a stop to it. I have thought of a plan;
it is this: The next time the fowler throws a net<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
over you, each of you must put your head through
one of the little holes in the net. Then all of you
together must fly away to the nearest thorn-bush.
You can leave the net on the thorn-bush and be free
yourselves."</p>

<p>The quails said that was a very good plan and they
would try it the next time the fowler threw the net
over them.</p>

<p>The very next day the fowler came and called them
together. Then he threw the net over them. The
quails lifted the net and flew away with it to the
nearest thorn-bush where they left it. They flew
back to their leader to tell him how well his plan had
worked.</p>

<p>The fowler was busy until evening getting his net
off the thorns and he went home empty-handed. The
next day the same thing happened, and the next.
His wife was angry because he did not bring home
any money, but the fowler said, "The fact is those
quails are working together now. The moment my
net is over them, off they fly with it, leaving it on a
thorn-bush. As soon as the quails begin to quarrel I
shall be able to catch them."</p>

<p>Not long after this, one of the quails in alighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on their feeding ground, trod by accident on another's
head. "Who trod on my head?" angrily cried the
second. "I did; but I didn't mean to. Don't be
angry," said the first quail, but the second quail was
angry and said mean things.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p032.jpg" width="475"
height="656" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
The quails lifted the net and flew away with it.
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Soon all the quails had taken sides in this quarrel.
When the fowler came that day he flung his net over
them, and this time instead of flying off with it, one
side said, "Now, you lift the net," and the other side
said, "Lift it yourself."</p>

<p>"You try to make us lift it all," said the quails on
one side. "No, we don't!" said the others, "you begin
and we will help," but neither side began.</p>

<p>So the quails quarreled, and while they were quarreling
the fowler caught them all in his net. He took
them to town and sold them for a good price.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII.<br />
THE MEASURE OF RICE</h2></div>


<p>At one time a dishonest king had a man called
the Valuer in his court. The Valuer set the
price which ought to be paid for horses and
elephants and the other animals. He also set the
price on jewelry and gold, and things of that kind.</p>

<p>This man was honest and just, and set the proper
price to be paid to the owners of the goods.</p>

<p>The king was not pleased with this Valuer, because
he was honest. "If I had another sort of a man as
Valuer, I might gain more riches," he thought.</p>

<p>One day the king saw a stupid, miserly peasant
come into the palace yard. The king sent for the
fellow and asked him if he would like to be the Valuer.
The peasant said he would like the position. So the
king had him made Valuer. He sent the honest
Valuer away from the palace.</p>

<p>Then the peasant began to set the prices on horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and elephants, upon gold and jewels. He did not
know their value, so he would say anything he chose.
As the king had made him Valuer, the people had to
sell their goods for the price he set.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p035.jpg" width="500"
height="289" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
So they went before the king.
</div></div>

<p>By and by a horse-dealer brought five hundred
horses to the court of this king. The Valuer came
and said they were worth a mere measure of rice.
So the king ordered the horse-dealer to be given the
measure of rice, and the horses to be put in the palace
stables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
The horse-dealer went then to see the honest man
who had been the Valuer, and told him what had happened.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked the horse-dealer.</p>

<p>"I think you can give a present to the Valuer which
will make him do and say what you want him to do
and say," said the man. "Go to him and give him
a fine present, then say to him: 'You said the horses
are worth a measure of rice, but now tell what a measure
of rice is worth! Can you value that standing
in your place by the king?' If he says he can, go
with him to the king, and I will be there, too."</p>

<p>The horse-dealer thought this was a good idea.
So he took a fine present to the Valuer, and said what
the other man had told him to say.</p>

<p>The Valuer took the present, and said: "Yes, I
can go before the king with you and tell what a measure
of rice is worth. I can value that now."</p>

<p>"Well, let us go at once," said the horse-dealer. So
they went before the king and his ministers in the
palace.</p>

<p>The horse-dealer bowed down before the king, and
said: "O King, I have learned that a measure of
rice is the value of my five hundred horses. But will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the king be pleased to ask the Valuer what is the value
of the measure of rice?"</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p037.jpg" width="500"
height="269" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
He ran away from the laughing crowd.
</div></div>

<p>The king, not knowing what had happened, asked:
"How now, Valuer, what are five hundred horses
worth?"</p>

<p>"A measure of rice, O King!" said he.</p>

<p>"Very good, then! If five hundred horses are
worth a measure of rice, what is the measure of rice
worth?"</p>

<p>"The measure of rice is worth your whole city,"
replied the foolish fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The ministers clapped their hands, laughing, and
saying, "What a foolish Valuer! How can such a
man hold that office? We used to think this great
city was beyond price, but this man says it is worth
only a measure of rice."</p>

<p>Then the king was ashamed, and drove out the foolish
fellow.</p>

<p>"I tried to please the king by setting a low price
on the horses, and now see what has happened to
me!" said the Valuer, as he ran away from the laughing
crowd.</p>

THE FOOLISH, TIMID RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time, a
Rabbit was asleep
under a palm-tree.</p>

<p>All at once he woke up,
and thought: "What if the
world should break up!
What then would become of
me?"</p>

<p>At that moment, some
Monkeys dropped a cocoanut.
It fell down on the
ground just back of the
Rabbit.</p>

<p>Hearing the noise, the
Rabbit said to himself: "The
earth is all breaking up!"</p>

<p>And he jumped up and
ran just as fast as he could, without even looking back
to see what made the noise.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p039.jpg" width="250"

<div class="caption">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Another Rabbit saw him running, and called after
him, "What are you running so fast for?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" he cried.</p>

<p>But the other Rabbit ran after him, begging to know
what was the matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p040.jpg" width="400"

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>Then the first Rabbit said: "Don't you know?
The earth is all breaking up!"</p>

<p>And on he ran, and the second Rabbit ran with him.</p>

<p>The next Rabbit they met ran with them when he
heard that the earth was all breaking up.</p>

<p>One Rabbit after another joined them, until there
were hundreds of Rabbits running as fast as they
could go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
They passed a Deer, calling out to him that the
earth was all breaking up. The Deer then ran with
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p041.jpg" width="500"
height="298" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
Saw the animals running.
</div></div>

<p>The Deer called to a Fox to come along because the
earth was all breaking up.</p>

<p>On and on they ran, and an Elephant joined them.</p>

<p>At last the Lion saw the animals running, and heard
their cry that the earth was all breaking up.</p>

<p>He thought there must be some mistake, so he ran
to the foot of a hill in front of them and roared three
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
This stopped them, for they knew the voice of the
King of Beasts, and they feared him.</p>

<p>"Why are you running so fast?" asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"Oh, King Lion," they answered him, "the earth is
all breaking up!"</p>

<p>"Who saw it breaking up?" asked the Lion.</p>

<p>"I didn't," said the Elephant. "Ask the Fox&mdash;he
told me about it."</p>

<p>"I didn't," said the Fox.</p>

<p>"The Rabbits told me about it," said the Deer.</p>

<p>One after another of the Rabbits said: "I did not
see it, but another Rabbit told me about it."</p>

<p>At last the Lion came to the Rabbit who had first
said the earth was all breaking up.</p>

<p>"Is it true that the earth is all breaking up?" the
Lion asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, O Lion, it is," said the Rabbit. "I was asleep
under a palm-tree. I woke up and thought, 'What
would become of me if the earth should all break up?'
At that very moment, I heard the sound of the earth
breaking up, and I ran away."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Lion, "you and I will go back to
the place where the earth began to break up, and see
what is the matter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
So the Lion put the little Rabbit on his back, and
away they went like the wind. The other animals
waited for them at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>The Rabbit told the Lion when they were near the
place where he slept, and the Lion saw just where the
Rabbit had been sleeping.</p>

<p>He saw, too, the cocoanut that had fallen to the
ground near by. Then the Lion said to the Rabbit,
"It must have been the sound of the cocoanut falling
to the ground that you heard. You foolish Rabbit!"</p>

<p>And the Lion ran back to the other animals, and
told them all about it.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the wise King of Beasts, they
might be running still.</p>

THE WISE AND THE FOOLISH MERCHANT</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time in a certain country a
thrifty merchant visited a great city and
bought a great supply of goods. He loaded
wagons with the goods, which he was going to sell as
he traveled through the country.</p>

<p>A stupid young merchant was buying goods in the
same city. He, too, was going to sell what he bought
as he traveled through the country.</p>

<p>They were both ready to start at the same time.</p>

<p>The thrifty merchant thought, "We cannot travel
together, for the men will find it hard to get wood
and water, and there will not be enough grass for
so many oxen. Either he or I ought to go first."</p>

<p>So he went to the young man and told him this, saying,
"Will you go before or come on after me?"</p>

<p>The other one thought, "It will be better for me to
go first. I shall then travel on a road that is not
cut up. The oxen will eat grass that has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
touched. The water will be clean. Also, I shall sell
my goods at what price I like." So he said, "Friend,
I will go on first."</p>

<p>This answer pleased the thrifty merchant. He said
to himself, "Those who go before will make the rough
places smooth. The old rank grass will have been
eaten by the oxen that have gone before, while my
oxen will eat the freshly grown tender shoots. Those
who go before will dig wells from which we shall
drink. Then, too, I will not have to bother about
setting prices, but I can sell my goods at the prices
set by the other man." So he said aloud, "Very well,
friend, you may go on first."</p>

<p>At once the foolish merchant started on his journey.
Soon he had left the city and was in the country. By
and by he came to a desert which he had to cross.
So he filled great water-jars with water, loaded
them into a large wagon and started across the
desert.</p>

<p>Now on the sands of this desert there lived a wicked
demon. This demon saw the foolish young merchant
coming and thought to himself, "If I can make him
empty those water-jars, soon I shall be able to overcome
him and have him in my power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
So the demon went further along the road and
changed himself into the likeness of a noble gentleman.
He called up a beautiful carriage, drawn by
milk-white oxen. Then he called ten other demons,
dressed them like men and armed them with bows and
arrows, swords and shields. Seated in his carriage,
followed by the ten demons, he rode back to meet the
merchant. He put mud on the carriage wheels, hung
water-lilies and wet grasses upon the oxen and the
carriage. Then he made the clothes the demons wore
and their hair all wet. Drops of water trickled down
over their faces just as if they had all come through
a stream.</p>

<p>As the demons neared the foolish merchant they
turned their carriage to one side of the way, saying
pleasantly, "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>The merchant replied, "We have come from the
great city back there and are going across the desert
to the villages beyond. You come dripping with mud
and carrying water-lilies and grasses. Does it rain
on the road you have come by? Did you come
through a stream?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The demon answered, "The dark streak across the
sky is a forest. In it there are ponds full of water-lilies.
The rains come often. What have you in all
those carts?"</p>

<p>"Goods to be sold," replied the merchant.</p>

<p>"But in that last big heavy wagon what do you
carry?" the demon asked.</p>

<p>"Jars full of water for the journey," answered the
merchant.</p>

<p>The demon said, "You have done well to bring
water as far as this, but there is no need of it beyond.
Empty out all that water and go on easily." Then
he added, "But we have delayed too long. Drive on!"
And he drove on until he was out of sight of the merchant.
Then he returned to his home with his followers
to wait for the night to come.</p>

<p>The foolish merchant did as the demon bade him and
emptied every jar, saving not even a cupful. On and
on they traveled and the streak on the sky faded with
the sunset. There was no forest, the dark line being
only clouds. No water was to be found. The men
had no water to drink and no food to eat, for they
had no water in which to cook their rice, so they went
thirsty and supperless to bed. The oxen, too, were
hungry and thirsty and dropped down to sleep here
and there. Late at night the demons fell upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and easily carried off every man. They drove the
oxen on ahead of them, but the loaded carts they did
not care to take away.</p>

<p>A month and a half after this the wise merchant
followed over the same road. He, too, was met on
the desert by the demon just as the other had been.
But the wise man knew the man was a demon because
he cast no shadow. When the demon told him of the
ponds in the forest ahead and advised him to throw
away the water-jars the wise merchant replied, "We
don't throw away the water we have until we get to
a place where we see there is more."</p>

<p>Then the demon drove on. But the men who were
with the merchant said, "Sir! those men told us that
yonder was the beginning of a great forest, and from
there onwards it was always raining. Their clothes
and hair were dripping with water. Let us throw
away the water-jars and go on faster with lighter
carts!"</p>

<p>Stopping all the carts the wise merchant asked the
men, "Have you ever heard any one say that there
was a lake or pond in this desert? You have lived
near here always."</p>

<p>"We never heard of a pond or lake," they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"Does any man feel a wind laden with dampness
blowing against him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," they answered.</p>

<p>"Can you see a rain cloud, any of you?" said he.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not one," they said.</p>

<p>"Those fellows were not men, they were demons!"
said the wise merchant. "They must have come out
to make us throw away the water. Then when we
were faint and weak they might have put an end to
us. Go on at once and don't throw away a single
half-pint of water."</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p050.jpg" width="500"

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
So they drove on and before nightfall they came
upon the loaded wagons belonging to the foolish merchant.</p>

<p>Then the thrifty merchant had his wagons drawn
up in a circle. In the middle of the circle he had the
oxen lie down, and also some of the men. He himself
with the head men stood on guard, swords in hand
and waited for the demons. But the demons did not
bother them. Early the next day the thrifty merchant
took the best of the wagons left by the foolish
merchant and went on safely to the city across the
desert.</p>

<p>There he sold all the goods at a profit and returned
with his company to his own city.</p>

<h2 id="XI">XI.<br />
THE ELEPHANT GIRLY-FACE</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time a king had an Elephant
named Girly-face. The Elephant was called
Girly-face because he was so gentle and good
and looked so kind. "Girly-face never hurts anybody,"
the keeper of the Elephants often said.</p>

<p>Now one night some robbers came into the courtyard
and sat on the ground just outside the stall where
Girly-face slept. The talk of the robbers awoke Girly-face.</p>

<p>"This is the way to break into a house," they said.
"Once inside the house kill any one who wakens. A
robber must not be afraid to kill. A robber must be
cruel and have no pity. He must never be good, even
for a moment."</p>

<p>Girly-face said to himself, "Those men are teaching
me how I should act. I will be cruel. I will
show no pity. I will not be good&mdash;not even for a moment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

He picked him up in his trunk and threw the poor keeper to the ground.
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
So the next morning when the keeper came to feed
Girly-face he picked him up in his trunk and threw
the poor keeper to the ground, killing him.</p>

<p>Another keeper ran to see what the trouble was,
and Girly-face killed him, too.</p>

<p>For days and days Girly-face was so ugly that no
one dared go near. The food was left for him, but
no man would go near him.</p>

<p>By and by the king heard of this and sent one of his
wise men to find out what ailed Girly-face.</p>

<p>The wise man had known Girly-face a long time.
He looked the Elephant over carefully and could find
nothing that seemed to be the matter.</p>

<p>He thought at last, "Girly-face must have heard
some bad men talking. Have there been any bad
men talking about here?" asked the wise man.</p>

<p>"Yes," one of the keepers said, "a band of robbers
were caught here a few weeks ago. They had met
in the yard to talk over their plans. They were
talking together near the stall where Girly-face
sleeps."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
So the wise man went back to the king. Said he,
"I think Girly-face has been listening to bad talk.
If you will send some good men to talk where Girly-face
can hear them I think he will be a good Elephant
once more."</p>

<p>So that night the king sent a company of the best
men to be found to sit and talk near the stall where
Girly-face lived. They said to one another, "It is
wrong to hurt any one. It is wrong to kill. Every
one should be gentle and good."</p>

<p>"Now those men are teaching me," thought Girly-face.
"I must be gentle and good. I must hurt no
one. I must not kill any one." And from that time
on Girly-face was tame and as good as ever an Elephant
could be.</p>

<h2 id="XII">XII.<br />
THE BANYAN DEER</h2></div>


<p>There was once a Deer the color of gold. His
eyes were like round jewels, his horns were
white as silver, his mouth was red like a
flower, his hoofs were bright and hard. He had a
large body and a fine tail.</p>

<p>He lived in a forest and was king of a herd of five
hundred Banyan Deer. Near by lived another herd
of Deer, called the Monkey Deer. They, too, had a
king.</p>

<p>The king of that country was fond of hunting the
Deer and eating deer meat. He did not like to go
alone so he called the people of his town to go with
him, day after day.</p>

<p>The townspeople did not like this for while they
were gone no one did their work. So they decided
to make a park and drive the Deer into it. Then the
king could go into the park and hunt and they could
go on with their daily work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
They made a park, planted grass in it and provided
water for the Deer, built a fence all around it and
drove the Deer into it.</p>

<p>Then they shut the gate and went to the king to
tell him that in the park near by he could find all the
Deer he wanted.</p>

<p>The king went at once to look at the Deer. First
he saw there the two Deer kings, and granted them
their lives. Then he looked at their great herds.</p>

<p>Some days the king would go to hunt the Deer,
sometimes his cook would go. As soon as any of the
Deer saw them they would shake with fear and run.
But when they had been hit once or twice they would
drop down dead.</p>

<p>The King of the Banyan Deer sent for the King of
the Monkey Deer and said, "Friend, many of the Deer
are being killed. Many are wounded besides those
who are killed. After this suppose one from my herd
goes up to be killed one day, and the next day let one
from your herd go up. Fewer Deer will be lost this
way."</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The Monkey Deer agreed. Each day the Deer
whose turn it was would go and lie down, placing its
head on the block. The cook would come and carry
off the one he found lying there.</p>

<p>One day the lot fell to a mother Deer who had a
young baby. She went to her king and said, "O King
of the Monkey Deer, let the turn pass me by until my
baby is old enough to get along without me. Then I
will go and put my head on the block."</p>

<p>But the king did not help her. He told her that
if the lot had fallen to her she must die.</p>

<p>Then she went to the King of the Banyan Deer and
asked him to save her.</p>

<p>"Go back to your herd. I will go in your place,"
said he.</p>

<p>The next day the cook found the King of the Banyan
Deer lying with his head on the block. The cook
went to the king, who came himself to find out about
this.</p>

<p>"King of the Banyan Deer! did I not grant you
your life? Why are you lying here?"</p>

<p>"O great King!" said the King of the Banyan Deer,
"a mother came with her young baby and told me
that the lot had fallen to her. I could not ask any
one else to take her place, so I came myself."</p>

park or forest."</p>

<h2 id="XIII">XIII.<br />
THE PRINCES AND THE WATER-SPRITE</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time a king had three sons. The
first was called Prince of the Stars. The next
was called the Moon Prince and the third was
called the Sun Prince. The king was so very happy
when the third son was born that he promised to give
the queen any boon she might ask.</p>

<p>The queen kept the promise in mind, waiting until
the third son was grown before asking the king to
give her the boon.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first birthday of the Sun Prince she
said to the king, "Great King, when our youngest child
was born you said you would give me a boon. Now
I ask you to give the kingdom to Sun Prince."</p>

<p>But the king refused, saying that the kingdom must
go to the oldest son, for it belonged by right to him.
Next it would belong by right to the second son, and
not until they were both dead could the kingdom go to
the third son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The queen went away, but the king saw that she
was not pleased with his answer. He feared that she
would do harm to the older princes to get them out of
the way of the Sun Prince.</p>

<p>So he called his elder sons and told them that they
must go and live in the forest until his death. "Then
come back and reign in the city that is yours by right,"
he said. And with tears he kissed them on the foreheads
and sent them away.</p>

<p>As they were going down out of the palace, after
saying good-by to their father, the Sun Prince called
to them, "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>And when he heard where they were going and
why, he said, "I will go with you, my brothers."</p>

<p>So off they started. They went on and on and by
and by they reached the forest. There they sat down
to rest in the shade of a pond. Then the eldest
brother said to Sun Prince, "Go down to the pond
and bathe and drink. Then bring us a drink while
we rest here."</p>

<p>Now the King of the Fairies had given this pond
to a water-sprite. The Fairy King had said to the
water-sprite, "You are to have in your power all who
go down into the water except those who give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
right answer to one question. Those who give the
right answer will not be in your power. The question
is, 'What are the Good Fairies like?'"</p>

<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p065.jpg" width="500"
height="310" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
The Sun Prince went into the pond.
</div></div>

<p>When the Sun Prince went into the pond the water-sprite
saw him and asked him the question, "What
are the Good Fairies like?"</p>

<p>"They are like the Sun and the Moon," said the Sun
Prince.</p>

<p>"You don't know what the Good Fairies are like,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
cried the water-sprite, and he carried the poor boy
down into his cave.</p>

<p>By and by the eldest brother said, "Moon Prince,
go down and see why our brother stays so long in the
pond!"</p>

<p>As soon as the Moon Prince reached the water's
edge the water-sprite called to him and said, "Tell me
what the Good Fairies are like!"</p>

<p>"Like the sky above us," replied the Moon Prince.</p>

<p>"You don't know, either," said the water-sprite,
and dragged the Moon Prince down into the cave
where the Sun Prince sat.</p>

<p>"Something must have happened to those two
brothers of mine," thought the eldest. So he went to
the pond and saw the marks of the footsteps where
his brothers had gone down into the water. Then
he knew that a water-sprite must live in that pond.
He girded on his sword, and stood with his bow in
his hand.</p>

<p>The water-sprite soon came along in the form of a
woodsman.</p>

<p>"You seem tired, Friend," he said to the prince.
"Why don't you bathe in the lake and then lie on the
bank and rest?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>But the prince knew that it was a water-sprite and
he said, "You have carried off my brothers!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the water-sprite.</p>

<p>"Why did you carry them off?"</p>

<p>"Because they did not answer my question," said
the water-sprite, "and I have power over all who go
down into the water except those who do give the
right answer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
"I will answer your question," said the eldest
brother. And he did. "The Good Fairies are like</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The pure in heart who fear to sin,</div>
<div class="line">The good, kindly in word and deed."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"O Wise Prince, I will bring back to you one of
your brothers. Which shall I bring?" said the water-sprite.</p>

<p>"Bring me the younger one," said the prince. "It
was on his account that our father sent us away. I
could never go away with Moon Prince and leave
poor Sun Prince here."</p>

<p>"O Wise Prince, you know what the good should
do and you are kind. I will bring back both your
brothers," said the water-sprite.</p>

<p>After that the three princes lived together in the
forest until the king died. Then they went back to
the palace. The eldest brother was made king and
he had his brothers rule with him. He also built a
home for the water-sprite in the palace grounds.</p>

<h2 id="XIV">XIV.<br />
THE KING'S WHITE ELEPHANT</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time a number of carpenters lived
on a river bank near a large forest. Every
day the carpenters went in boats to the forest
to cut down the trees and make them into lumber.</p>

<p>One day while they were at work an Elephant came
limping on three feet to them. He held up one foot
and the carpenters saw that it was swollen and sore.
Then the Elephant lay down and the men saw that
there was a great splinter in the sore foot. They
pulled it out and washed the sore carefully so that in
a short time it would be well again.</p>

<p>Thankful for the cure, the Elephant thought:
"These carpenters have done so much for me, I must
be useful to them."</p>

<p>So after that the Elephant used to pull up trees for
the carpenters. Sometimes when the trees were
chopped down he would roll the logs down to the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Other times he brought their tools for them. And
the carpenters used to feed him well morning, noon
and night.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>Now this Elephant had a son who was white all
over&mdash;a beautiful, strong young one. Said the old
Elephant to himself, "I will take my son to the place
in the forest where I go to work each day so that he
may learn to help the carpenters, for I am no longer
young and strong."</p>

hurt and took him to them. The white Elephant did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
as his father told him to do and helped the carpenters
and they fed him well.</p>

<p>When the work was done at night the young Elephant
went to play in the river. The carpenters' children
played with him, in the water and on the bank.
He liked to pick them up in his trunk and set them
on the high branches of the trees and then let them
climb down on his back.</p>

One day the king came down the river and saw
this beautiful white Elephant working for the carpenters.
The king at once wanted the Elephant for
his own and paid the carpenters a great price for him.
Then with a last look at his playmates, the children,
the beautiful white Elephant went on with the king.</p>

the best care of him as long as he lived.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an Ox named Big

on a large farm.</p>

<p>Now the farmer had an only daughter and she was
soon to be married. Her mother gave orders that the
Pig should be fattened for the wedding feast.</p>

<p>Little Red noticed that the Pig was fed on choice
food. He said to his brother, "How is it, Big Red,
that you and I are given only straw and grass to eat,
while we do all the hard work on the farm? That
lazy Pig does nothing but eat the choice food the
farmer gives him."</p>

<p>Said his brother, "My dear Little Red, envy him
not. That little Pig is eating the food of death! He
is being fattened for the wedding feast. Eat your
straw and grass and be content and live long."</p>

GRANNY'S BLACKIE</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time a rich man gave a baby Elephant

<p>She took the best of care of this great baby
and soon became very fond of him.</p>

<p>The children in the village called her Granny, and
they called the Elephant "Granny's Blackie."</p>

<p>The Elephant carried the children on his back all
over the village. They shared their goodies with him
and he played with them.</p>

<p>"Please, Blackie, give us a swing," they said to him
almost every day.</p>

<p>"Come on! Who is first?" Blackie answered and
picked them up with his trunk, swung them high in
the air, and then put them down again, carefully.</p>

<p>But Blackie never did any work.</p>

<p>He ate and slept, played with the children, and visited
with Granny.</p>

<p>So next morning, bright and early, he started down
to the river bank.</p>

<p>There he found a man who was in great trouble.
There was a long line of wagons so heavily loaded
that the oxen could not draw them through the shallow
water.</p>

<p>When the man saw Blackie standing on the bank
he asked, "Who owns this Elephant? I want to hire
him to help my Oxen pull these wagons across the
river."</p>

<p>A child standing near by said, "That is Granny's
Blackie."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the man, "I'll pay two pieces of
silver for each wagon this Elephant draws across the
river."</p>

<p>Blackie was glad to hear this promise. He went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
into the river, and drew one wagon after another
across to the other side.</p>

<p>Then he went up to the man for the money.</p>

<p>The man counted out one piece of silver for each
wagon.</p>

<p>When Blackie saw that the man had counted out
but one piece of silver for each wagon, instead of
two, he would not touch the money at all. He stood
in the road and would not let the wagons pass him.</p>

<p>The man tried to get Blackie out of the way, but
not one step would he move.</p>

<p>Then the man went back and counted out another
piece of silver for each of the wagons and put the silver
in a bag tied around Blackie's neck.</p>

<p>Then Blackie started for home, proud to think that
he had a present for Granny.</p>

<p>The children had missed Blackie and had asked
Granny where he was, but she said she did not know
where he had gone.</p>

<p>They all looked for him but it was nearly night before
they heard him coming.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Blackie? And what is that
around your neck?" the children cried, running to
meet their playmate.</p>

But Blackie would not stop to talk with his playmates.
He ran straight home to Granny.</p>

<p>"Oh, Blackie!" she said, "Where have you been?
What is in that bag?" And she took the bag off his
neck.</p>

<p>Blackie told her that he had earned some money
for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Blackie, Blackie," said Granny, "how hard
you must have worked to earn these pieces of silver!
What a good Blackie you are!"</p>

<p>And after that Blackie did all the hard work and
Granny rested, and they were both very happy.</p>

THE CRAB AND THE CRANE</h2></div>


<p>In the Long Ago there was a summer when very
little rain fell.</p>

<p>All the Animals suffered for want of water,
but the Fishes suffered most of all.</p>

<p>In one pond full of Fishes, the water was very low
indeed.</p>

<p>A Crane sat on the bank watching the Fishes.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked a little Fish.</p>

<p>"I am thinking about you Fishes there in the pond.
It is so nearly dry," answered the Crane.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Crane went on, "I was wishing I might
do something for you. I know of a pond in the deep
woods where there is plenty of water."</p>

<p>"I declare," said the little Fish, "you are the first
Crane that ever offered to help a Fish."</p>

<p>"That may be," said the Crane, "but the water is
so low in your pond. I could easily carry you one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
one on my back to that other pond where there is
plenty of water and food and cool shade."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there is any such pond," said the
little Fish. "What you wish to do is to eat us, one
by one."</p>

<p>"If you don't believe me," said the Crane, "send
with me one of the Fishes whom you can believe. I'll
show him the pond and bring him back to tell you all
about it."</p>

<p>A big Fish heard the Crane and said, "I will go
with you to see the pond&mdash;I may as well be eaten by
the Crane as to die here."</p>

<p>So the Crane put the big Fish on his back and
started for the deep woods.</p>

<p>Soon the Crane showed the big Fish the pool of
water. "See how cool and shady it is here," he said,
"and how much larger the pond is, and how full it
is!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the big Fish, "take me back to the little
pond and I'll tell the other Fishes all about it." So
back they went.</p>

<p>The Fishes all wanted to go when they heard the
big Fish talk about the fine pond which he had seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p086.jpg" width="400"

<div class="caption">
So the Crane put the big Fish on his back and started for
the deep woods.
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Then the Crane picked up another Fish and carried
it away. Not to the pool, but into the woods
where the other Fishes could not see them.</p>

<p>Then the Crane put the Fish down and ate it. The
Crane went back for another Fish. He carried it to
the same place in the woods and ate it, too.</p>

<p>This he did until he had eaten all the Fishes in the
pond.</p>

<p>The next day the Crane went to the pond to see if
he had left a Fish. There was not one left, but there
was a Crab on the sand.</p>

<p>"Little Crab," said the Crane, "would you let me
take you to the fine pond in the deep woods where I
took the Fishes?"</p>

<p>"But how could you carry me?" asked the Crab.</p>

<p>"Oh, easily," answered the Crane. "I'll take you
on my back as I did the Fishes."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," said the Crab, "I can't go that
way. I am afraid you might drop me. If I could
take hold of your neck with my claws, I would go.
You know we Crabs have a tight grip."</p>

<p>The Crane knew about the tight grip of the Crabs,
and he did not like to have the Crab hold on with his
claws. But he was hungry, so he said:</p>

<p>"Very well, hold tight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p088.jpg" width="400"

And off went the Crane with the Crab.
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
And off went the Crane with the Crab.</p>

<p>When they reached the place where the Crane had
eaten the Fishes, the Crane said:</p>

<p>"I think you can walk the rest of the way. Let go
of my neck."</p>

<p>"I see no pond," said the Crab. "All I can see is
a pile of Fish bones. Is that all that is left of the
Fishes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Crane, "and if you will let go of
my neck, your shell will be all that will be left of you."</p>

<p>And the Crane put his head down near the ground
so that the Crab could get off easily.</p>

<p>But the Crab pinched the Crane's neck so that his
head fell off.</p>

<p>"Not my shell, but your bones are left to dry with
the bones of the Fishes," said the Crab.</p>

<h2 id="XVIII">XVIII.<br />
WHY THE OWL IS NOT KING OF
THE BIRDS</h2></div>


<p>Why is it that Crows torment the Owls as they
sleep in the daytime? For the same reason
that the Owls try to kill the Crows while
they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Listen to a tale of long ago and then you will see
why.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, the people who lived together
when the world was young took a certain man for
their king. The four-footed animals also took one of
their number for their king. The fish in the ocean
chose a king to rule over them. Then the birds gathered
together on a great flat rock, crying:</p>

<p>"Among men there is a king, and among the beasts,
and the fish have one, too; but we birds have none.
We ought to have a king. Let us choose one now."</p>

<p>And so the birds talked the matter over and at last
they all said, "Let us have the Owl for our king."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter2em"><img src="images/p091.jpg" width="500"
height="341" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
"See how sour he looks right now."
</div></div>

<p>No, not all, for one old Crow rose up and said, "For
my part, I don't want the Owl to be our king. Look
at him now while you are all crying that you want
him for your king. See how sour he looks right now.
If that's the cross look he wears when he is happy,
how will he look when he is angry? I, for one, want
no such sour-looking king!"</p>

<p>Then the Crow flew up into the air crying, "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
like it! I don't like it!" The Owl rose and followed
him. From that time on the Crows and the Owls
have been enemies. The birds chose a Turtle Dove
to be their king, and then flew to their homes.</p>
